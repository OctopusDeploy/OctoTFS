This extension provides Build and Release tasks to integrate with [Octopus Deploy](http://octopus.com), as well as a dashboard widget to show the status of a deployment in Octopus.

[Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com) is great for deploying ASP.NET or .NET Core applications running on IIS or Azure, Windows services, SQL databases, and much, much more.

<div style="border:1px solid #888;background-color: #ffc;color:#444;padding:5px;">Note: This extension is only compatible with Azure DevOps, Team Foundation Server (TFS) 2017 Update 2 and above, and Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS).<br/><br/>There is an alternative extension compatible with TFS 2015 Update 2 and above. See <a href="https://g.octopushq.com/TFS-VSTS-compat">the Octopus Documentation</a> for extension compatibility details and a download link.

## Requirements

You will need a minimum build agent version of `2.115.0` with .NET Core SDK `2.0` or later. When targeting build agents without the SDK, you can use the **.NET Core SDK Installer** task to install it. Generally the Hosted Linux, Mac and Hosted VS2017 agent queues already provide it, however please refer to Microsoft documentation regarding what capabilities are provided by which hosted agent pools.

## Add Octo Command Line tool

The Octopus tasks require the Octo Command Line tool, which can be supplied any of the following ways:

* Add the **Octopus tools installer** task to the build pipeline, before other Octopus tasks. If you leave the version as `embedded`, a built-in copy of the Octo command line tool will be supplied to the other tasks. If you set the version to `latest` or a specific number like `6.10.0`, that version will be downloaded and supplied to the other tasks. If the download fails, the built-in copy of the tool will be used.
* Update the system `PATH` environment variable to include a folder containing `Octo.exe` or `Octo.cmd`, on all systems running VSTS agents. You will need to restart the `VSTS Agent` service (or the whole system) for the change to take effect.
* If the Octo command line tool is not supplied, the Octopus tasks will attempt to download the latest version themselves.

## Add a service connection to Octopus Deploy

Before adding any Build or Release tasks to your process, configure an "Octopus Deploy" service connection in the **Project Settings** under **Service connections**.

You'll need an API Key for a user that has sufficient permissions for the tasks you want to perform in your build and release process.
For example, if your build needs to create a Release for Project A, the user who owns that API key will need ReleaseCreate role either unscoped or scoped to Project A.

This extension adds the following tasks:

- Octopus tools installer
- Package Application for Octopus
- Push Packages to Octopus
- Push Package Metadata to Octopus
- Create Octopus Release
- Deploy Octopus Release
- Promote Octopus Release

And the following widget:

## <a name="tools-installer"></a>![Installer Icon](img/octopus_installer.png) Octopus tools installer

Optional. Use this task to supply the Octo command line tool to other tasks, by downloading them or using a built-in copy.

Alternatively, you can supply the tool using the system `PATH` environment variable, or allow the other tasks to download the latest version themselves. For more information, see [Add Octo Command Line tool](#add-octo-command-line-tool) above.

 Options include:

 * **Octopus Tool Version**: If you leave the version as `embedded`, a built-in copy of the tool will be supplied to the other tasks. If you set the version to `latest` or a specific number like `6.10.0`, that version will be downloaded and supplied to the other tasks. If the download fails, the built-in copy of the tool will be used.
