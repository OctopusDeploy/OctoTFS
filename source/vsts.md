This extension provides Build and Release tasks to integrate with [Octopus Deploy](http://octopus.com), as well as a dashboard widget to show the status of a deployment in Octopus.

[Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com) is great for deploying ASP.NET or .NET Core applications running on IIS or Azure, Windows services, SQL databases, and much, much more.

<div style="border:1px solid #888;background-color: #ffc;color:#444;padding:5px;">Note: This extension is only compatible with Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and Team Foundation Server (TFS) 2017 Update 1 and above.<br/>There is an alternative extension compatible with TFS 2015 Update 2 and above.<br/>See <a href="https://g.octopushq.com/TFS-VSTS-compat">the Octopus Documentation</a> for extension compatibility details and a download link for the alternative extension.

## Requirements
A minimum build agent version of `2.115.0` with dotnet core runtime 2.0 or later. When targeting build agents which do not have this capability, you can opt to use the dotnet installer task to satisfy this condition. An internet connection
is also required for tasks to download the Octopus tools when not available on a build agent.

### Azure DevOps (VSTS) Build Agents
Generally the Hosted Linux, Mac and Hosted VS2017 agent queues would satisfy the dotnet core requirements, however please refer to Microsoft documentation regarding what capabilities are provided by which hosted agent pools. The Octopus tasks
will automatically download, cache and use the latest version of the Octopus tools unless overridden by an installer task.

### TFS Build Agents / VSTS Custom agents
Unless your build agent has the portable version of the Octopus tools in the environment path the tasks will attempt to download and cache the Octopus tools. You can avoid subsequent downloads by using a known version in an installer task at the start of your build definition.

## Create an Octopus Deploy Connected Service
Before adding any Build or Release tasks to your process, configure an "Octopus Deploy" connected service in the administration section for your project.

You'll need an API Key for a user that has sufficient permissions for the tasks you want to perform in your build and release process.
For example, if your build needs to create a Release for Project A, the user who owns that API key will need ReleaseCreate role either unscoped or scoped to Project A.
